ASP football 5.0

This is the start of idea collection for upgrading the http://www.brainjar.com/AspFootballPool/ to a more modern platform/language.  The corresponding forum http://philwojo.com/ASP_Football_Forum_phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=501.

Ideas as of now-

Upgrades- (changes to structure, same features)
1) HTML 5 or better
2) Migrate away from ASP
3) Migrate away from Access - preferably somthing cheaper to host

Enhancements- (changes or increased features)
1)
